wake_latency 
=============

This kernel module is used to measure the wake-up latency for various 
kernel tasks -- including a kernel thread, a tasklet, a workqueue task, 
and so on.

The front-end test tool for this module is wl_test.c. It allows some 
setup of background cpu load, and tests the latencies of the kernel 
tasks. Each test is repeated N times. The avg and max latencies are 
reported. For each iteration, the kernel module registers the current 
time at microsecond resolution, triggers the to-be-tested task (either
by initializing or waking it up). When the task is running, it will 
record the new time. Ther module will keep stastistics of the latencies.

The userspace front-end wl_test.c will use the module's interface
/dev/wake_latency to do the tests, and it will also run a userspace 
thread to compare kernel space vs. userspace response latencies.

INSTALL
=======

Run make under the directory to build the kernel module (wake_latency.ko)
and the user space tool (wl_test).
  $ make

To clean the directory
  $ make clean

To load the kernel modules
  # insmod wake_latency.ko

To run a test
  # ./wl_test <N>
where <N> is the number of additional threads to be run to perform the test
under extra CPU load.

Android port
============

The source code can also be ported to Android. Instructions are
in the android directory.
