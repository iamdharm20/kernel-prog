No Forced Preemption

The context switch is done only when we return from the kernel. Lets take an example :

    We have 2 threads â€“ one with high real time priority(50) and the other with low RT priority(30)
    The high priority thread went to sleep for 3 seconds
    The low priority threads calls a kernel code that last for 5 seconds
    After 5 seconds the low priority thread returns from the kernel
    The high priority thread will wake up (2 seconds late)


    The high priority goes to sleep for 3 seconds.
    The low priority thread is sleeping for one second and then calls the kernel
    The high priority is wake after 6 seconds:
